## ⏰ Internship Timeline

| Week | Phase | Focus | Deliverable |
|------|-------|-------|-------------|
| Week 1 | **Research** | Environment setup, understand ERPNext, read docs | Working local setup |
| Week 2 | **Build** | Implement indexing, exercises, start building tool | First code contributions |
| **Week 3** | **Migrate** ← YOU ARE HERE | Test on real codebase, PRs, validate parity | Working features |
| Week 4 | **Verify & Document** | Measure effectiveness, document learnings | Final demo + evidence |

### Extension Criteria

The internship may be **extended based on your involvement**:

| Factor | What We Look For |
|--------|------------------|
| **Active Participation** | Regular commits, PR reviews, asking questions |
| **Quality Work** | Tests pass, code follows patterns, thoughtful solutions |
| **Communication** | Responsive in Teams/GitHub, attends sync meetings |
| **Initiative** | Proposes improvements, helps other interns |
| **Learning Velocity** | Shows growth, applies feedback quickly |

**If extending**: Focus shifts to deeper features, leading reviews, mentoring newer interns.

---

## 🗣️ Communication Protocols

### Primary Channels

| Channel | Use For | Response Time |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| **GitHub Issues** | Technical questions, code discussions | Within 24 hours |
| **GitHub PR Reviews** | Code feedback, approvals | Within 24 hours |
| **Teams (General)** | Announcements, general discussion | Check daily |
| **Teams (Support)** | Help requests, blockers | Same day if urgent |
| **Discord** | Casual discussion, peer help | Best effort |

### Communication Expectations

**Research First, Ask Second** (The "Rainforest Test"):
1. Search existing docs/code for 10 minutes
2. Try to solve it yourself
3. If still stuck, ask with context:
   - What you're trying to do
   - What you've tried
   - Specific error/blocker

**Good Question Example**:
> "I'm implementing `ValidateBalance()` in exercise 2. Running `go test` gives `expected true, got false` on line 45. I checked the mock data and 'Sales - ACME' is present. What am I missing?"

**Bad Question Example**:
> "It doesn't work"

### Weekly Sync

- **When**: Friday demos with mentor
- **Format**: Show what you built, discuss blockers, plan next week
- **Preparation**: Update progress in your PR or issue comments

---

## 🎯 Active Participation Requirements

### Minimum Expectations (Week 3)

| Requirement | Frequency |
|-------------|-----------|
| Commit meaningful code | 3+ times per week |
| Respond to PR comments | Within 24 hours |
| Post progress update | Weekly in Teams or GitHub |
| Attend weekly sync | Every Friday |
| Review peer PRs (optional but encouraged) | 1-2 per week |

### Signs of Strong Participation

✅ Asks clarifying questions before implementing
✅ Proposes solutions, not just reports problems
✅ Helps other interns in chat
✅ Commits small, focused PRs (10-50 lines, not 1000)
✅ Responds to feedback positively and quickly

### Signs of Weak Participation

❌ Silent for days with no updates
❌ Large "dump" PRs with many unrelated changes
❌ Ignoring review comments
❌ Not asking for help when stuck (suffer in silence)
❌ Skipping weekly syncs without notice

## 🧠 The Core Insight: Bounded Context Strategy

> *"I want to extract the Accounts module, but it depends on Stock, Selling, and other modules. Don't I need to migrate everything at once?"*
>
> **No.** This is the core insight from Sam Newman's *Monolith to Microservices* and Michael Feathers' *Working Effectively with Legacy Code*.

**Read the [main README](../README.md#but-the-accounts-module-has-dependencies) for the full diagram.**

### The Key Pattern: Interface-Based Isolation

### Why This Matters for Your Work

| Book | Author | Pattern You'll Learn |
|------|--------|---------------------|
| **Monolith to Microservices** | Sam Newman | Strangler Fig, Branch by Abstraction |
| **Working Effectively with Legacy Code** | Michael Feathers | Seams, Characterization Tests |
| **Domain-Driven Design** | Eric Evans | Bounded Contexts, Anti-Corruption Layer |
| **Clean Architecture** | Robert C. Martin | Ports & Adapters, Dependency Inversion |

**Each exercise teaches you one of these patterns.**

---

## 🎯 The Big Picture: Two Parallel Goals

You're learning **two things simultaneously**:

### Goal 1: Legacy Modernization Architecture

The exercises teach you the **patterns** that make incremental migration possible:
- **Interface isolation** (Exercise 3: Repository Pattern)
- **Test doubles** (Exercise 2, 3, 4: Mocks, Stubs, Fakes)
- **Parity verification** (Exercise 4: Prove Go = Python)

### Goal 2: Code Intelligence for AI Assistants

Your Code Intelligence Platform will **extract** and **explain** these patterns:
- **Entity extraction** (Exercise 1: GLEntry struct → your tool parses these)
- **Business rule identification** (Exercise 2: Validation → your tool finds these)
- **Dependency mapping** (Exercise 3: Interfaces → your tool traces these)
- **Parity metrics** (Exercise 4: Your tool's success measure)

```

│  You can't build tools that extract what you don't understand.              │
│                                                                              │
│  By DOING the modernization (exercises), you learn:                         │
│  • What patterns exist in legacy code                                       │
│  • What makes code extractable vs entangled                                 │

│  Then your Code Intelligence tool can:                                      │
│  • Identify these patterns automatically                                    │

### How Each Exercise Connects to Both Goals

| Exercise | Architectural Pattern (Goal 1) | Code Intelligence (Goal 2) |
|----------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|
| 🟢 **1. GLEntry Struct** | **Domain Modeling** — Understand the core entity | Your AST parser must extract entities like this |
| 🟡 **2. Validation** | **Characterization Test** — Capture existing behavior | Your tool finds business rules in `frappe.throw()` patterns |
| 🟡 **3. Repository** | **Ports & Adapters** — Interface-based isolation | Your tool uses same pattern for pluggable vector storage |
| 🔴 **4. Integration Test** | **Parity Verification** — Prove Go = Python | **This IS your tool's success metric** |

> 📚 **Key Reference**: The [main README](../README.md) has the full architectural diagrams. Read "But The Accounts Module Has Dependencies!" section before starting exercises.

> 💡 **The Connection**: You can't build tools that extract what you don't understand. By DOING the modernization, you learn what patterns exist in legacy code — then your Code Intelligence tool can identify them automatically.

### Exercise Difficulty Levels

| Level | Description | Time |
|-------|-------------|------|
| 🟢 **Beginner** | Fill in struct fields, simple functions | 30 min |
| 🟡 **Intermediate** | Implement validation, write tests | 1-2 hours |
| 🔴 **Advanced** | Full feature implementation | Half day |

---

## Exercise 1: Complete the GLEntry Struct (🟢 Beginner)

**Goal:** Learn the GLEntry data structure by completing missing fields.

**Location:** `exercises/01-glentry-struct/`

```bash
# Navigate to exercise
cd exercises/01-glentry-struct

# Read the instructions
cat README.md

# Open the file to complete
code glentry.go

# Run tests to check your work
go test -v
```

**What you'll do:**
1. Open `glentry.go` - you'll see a partial struct with `// TODO` comments
2. Fill in the missing fields based on the comments
3. Run `go test` - tests will pass when you're done correctly

**Success criteria:** All tests pass ✅

---

## Exercise 2: Implement Validation (🟡 Intermediate)

**Goal:** Write a function that validates GL entries balance.

**Location:** `exercises/02-validation/`

```bash
cd exercises/02-validation
cat README.md
code validation.go
go test -v
```

**What you'll do:**
1. Implement `ValidateBalance()` function
2. Handle edge cases (empty slice, single entry)
3. Use the provided helper functions

---

## Exercise 3: Repository Pattern (🟡 Intermediate)

**Goal:** Implement a simple in-memory repository.

**Location:** `exercises/03-repository/`

**What you'll learn:**
- Interface-based design
- Dependency injection
- Go's implicit interface implementation

---

## Exercise 4: Write an Integration Test (🔴 Advanced)

**Goal:** Write a realistic test scenario like `TestRealisticSalesInvoiceGLEntries`.

**Location:** `exercises/04-integration-test/`

**What you'll learn:**
- Table-driven testing

## Code Patterns Cheat Sheet

### Pattern 1: Table-Driven Tests

```go
func TestSomething(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name     string      // Describe the test case
        input    InputType   // Test input
        expected OutputType  // Expected result
    }{
        {
            name:     "valid_input",
            input:    InputType{...},
            expected: OutputType{...},
        },
        // Add more cases here
    }

    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            result := FunctionUnderTest(tt.input)
            if result != tt.expected {
                t.Errorf("got %v, want %v", result, tt.expected)
            }
        })
    }
}
```

### Pattern 2: Interface + Mock

```go
// 1. Define interface (what we need)
type AccountLookup interface {
    GetAccount(name string) (*Account, error)
}

// 2. Create mock for tests
type mockAccountLookup struct {
    accounts map[string]*Account
}

func (m *mockAccountLookup) GetAccount(name string) (*Account, error) {
    if acc, ok := m.accounts[name]; ok {
        return acc, nil
    }
    return nil, fmt.Errorf("account not found: %s", name)
}

// 3. Use in tests
func TestWithMock(t *testing.T) {
    mock := &mockAccountLookup{
        accounts: map[string]*Account{
            "Sales - ACME": {Name: "Sales - ACME", Disabled: false},
        },
    }

    engine := &Engine{Accounts: mock}
    // Now test with controlled data
}
```

### Pattern 3: Error Handling

```go
// Define typed error
type ValidationError struct {
    Field   string
    Message string
}

func (e *ValidationError) Error() string {
    return fmt.Sprintf("%s: %s", e.Field, e.Message)
}

// Use it
func Validate(entry GLEntry) error {
    if entry.Account == "" {
        return &ValidationError{
            Field:   "Account",
            Message: "account is required",
        }
    }
    return nil
}

// Check specific error type in tests
var validationErr *ValidationError
if errors.As(err, &validationErr) {
    // Handle validation error
}
```
